# User-Defined Methods

## What is a method?
A **method** is a named list of statements.
- A method definition consists of the new method's name and a block of statements, such as `public static void printPizzaArea() { /* block of statements */ }`.
- **Example**: Write a method that prints out "Hello!".
- A method call is an invocation of a method's name, causing the method's statements to execute.
