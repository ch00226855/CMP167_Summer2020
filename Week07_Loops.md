# Week 7
# Loops (Continued)

## Loops and Strings
- Iterating through a string with a for loop
- Format:
```java
for (int i = 0; i < someString.length(); i++) {
  // do something to someString.charAt(i)
}
```
- **Example:** Count the number of digits in a string.
- Multiple iterations using a while loop
- **Example:** Remove extra spaces in a string

## Nested Loops
- A **nested loop** is a loop that appears in the body of another loop. 
- The nested loops are commonly referred to as the **inner loop** and **outer loop**.
- **Example 1**: Write a for loop whose loop index `i` goes through 1 to 5. For each index value, print that value 10 times.
- **Example 2**: Write a for loop whose loop index `i` goes through 1 to 5. For each index value, print that first 10 powers of that value.
- **Example 3**: Write a for loop whose loop index goes through 1 to 5. For each index value, print a star `*`  `i` times.
- **Example 4**: Write a for loop whose loop index goes through 1 to 5. For each index value, print all numbers between 0 and `i`.
- **Example 5**: Write a for loop whose loop index goes through 1 to 5. For each index value, print all numbers from `i` to 0.
