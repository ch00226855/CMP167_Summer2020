# Week 3
# Variables (Continued)

## Constant Variables
A good practice is to minimize the use of literal numbers in code.
- It improves code readability: `newPrice = origPrice - 5` vs. `newPrice = origPrice - priceDiscount`.
- It is easier to modify the code. If price discount is changed to 10, the programmer only need to change the value of priceDiscount.
- If there is a number that does not require change, assign it to a **constant variable**.
  - add keyword `final` to its declaration.
  - Use only upper case letters and _ to form its name, making it clearly visible in code.
  - Challenge 2.9.1: Using constants in expressions.
