# Week 11
# Classes and Objects

## Introduction to Objects
As the number of variables and methods increases, it becomes increasingly challenging to manage them. An appealing idea is to group them according to which **object** they are refering to.
- Illustration 8.1.2: Grouping variables/methods as objects.

## Introduction to Classes
As many objects share the similar group of variables and methods, they are abstracted as a **class**. For example, a restaurant defines a data type that has a name, a rating, a menu, etc.
- **Example**: Define a Restaurant class with member variable name, rating, and menu.
